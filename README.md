# AB_testing_Website_versions
This project is about performing A/B testing on two website versions(old/new) and analyzing users' behavior.
We have a conversion rate of 13% for the older version. We need to get at least a 15% conversion rate to publish a new version.
We perform hypothesis testing and see which version is preferred by most of the customers.
